We're excited to announce that **staking is now live** on the Atto network! This marks a major milestone in our journey toward a fully decentralized, community-driven cryptocurrency.

Starting today, you can earn ATTO passively simply by holding Atto and delegating your balance to a voter of your choice.

## What Is Staking?

Staking allows you to earn rewards by helping secure and decentralize the Atto network. When you delegate your balance to a [voter](/explorer/voters), you contribute to the network's consensus mechanism and receive **daily payouts** based on the current APY.

Unlike traditional proof-of-stake systems that require locking your funds, **Atto's staking keeps your funds fully liquid**—you can spend them anytime. However, the longer you hold, the higher your rewards become, reaching their maximum after 30 days of consistent holding. This creates the perfect balance: complete freedom to use your funds whenever you need them, while rewarding those who choose to hold.

## Current Rewards

The staking APY is dynamic and depends on two factors:

1. **Base APY**: Currently at <Metric name="distribution.staking.annual-percentage-yield" suffix="%" />, starting at 200% when circulating supply is low and decreasing as more Atto enters circulation
2. **GSI Adjustment**: The [Growth Stability Index](/docs/growth-stability-index) (currently <Metric name="distribution.growth-stability-index" suffix="" />) adjusts the effective APY based on market conditions

**Current effective APY: <Metric name="distribution.staking.annual-percentage-yield.effective" suffix="%" />** (base APY × GSI)

## How to Start Staking

Getting started with staking takes just a few minutes:

### Step 1: Ensure You Have Enough Atto

You need at least **$10 USD worth** of Atto in your wallet to be eligible for staking rewards.

### Step 2: Open the Wallet and Navigate to Staking

Log into your [Atto wallet](https://wallet.atto.cash) and look for the staking or delegation section.

### Step 3: Choose a Voter

Browse the list of available voters and select one to delegate your balance to. Consider these factors when choosing:

- **Share Percentage**: How much of the rewards the voter shares with delegators
- **Total Delegation**: Voters with lower delegation may offer better reward rates due to the 180M Atto cap
- **Reliability**: Check when the voter last voted to ensure they're active

You can browse all active voters also on our [voter explorer](/explorer/voters).

### Step 4: Delegate Your Balance

Select your chosen voter and confirm the delegation. Your balance remains fully accessible—you're not locking anything.

### Step 5: Receive Daily Rewards

That's it! Rewards are calculated and distributed automatically once per day. Just make sure to:

- **Stay active**: Make at least one transaction every 30 days to remain eligible
- **Log in regularly**: Open your wallet to receive any pending transactions

## Understanding Your Rewards

### Effective Balance

Your rewards are based on your **effective balance**, which is:

- The average of your daily balances over the past 30 days
- Capped at your current balance

This system rewards consistent holders and prevents gaming by briefly inflating balances.

### Voter Cap

Each voter has a cap of **180 million Atto** in total delegated balance. If a voter exceeds this cap, rewards are proportionally reduced for all delegators. Choosing voters with lower total delegation can maximize your returns.
