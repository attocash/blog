We’re excited to announce the official release of the **[Web Wallet](https://wallet.atto.cash)**! The wallet has been available on desktops for some time, and we initially planned to release it on Android and iOS next. However, after conducting some market research, we learned that many people are cautious about installing unknown software—especially for cryptocurrencies.

In hindsight, this was a strategic oversight on our part. While we completely understand those concerns now, it never crossed our minds during the original development plan. As a result, we decided to change our approach and **launch a web-based wallet**.

## Why Web?

- **Platform Coverage**: A web wallet is accessible on any device with a modern browser, covering desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **No Direct Code Execution**: Users don’t need to install unverified software on their phones or computers.
- **Quick Updates**: We can quickly fix bugs and deploy new features without having to go through app store approval processes.

## Known Issue

The community has reported a bug that might cause problems for some users. We’re still investigating, and we don't expect it to affect most of the users. If you encounter any issues, please get in touch.

## What’s Next?

We’re currently exploring the development of **Atto Miner**. Rest assured, we’re not changing our consensus mechanism or wasting energy on meaningless computation. Instead, we aim to create a **fair, auditable, and anonymous** way to distribute rewards—and we’re looking at **[folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/)** as a potential platform. Stay tuned for future updates!

Thanks for reading, and we appreciate your continued support as we refine and expand the Atto ecosystem!
