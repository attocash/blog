If you've ever heard about Atto and Nano, you might wonder, "Is Atto just a fork of Nano?" It's a fair question!
After all, Atto and Nano share many of the same goals and even some design ideas, so it's easy to see why people make that assumption.

But here's the key thing: Atto is not a direct fork of Nano; it’s a unique project built from scratch, even though it draws plenty of
inspiration from Nano.

In this post, we'll explain how Atto relates to Nano, what makes it different, and why it was created as a new project. Let's dive in!

## Shared Vision, Different Journey

Atto and Nano **share the same philosophy** about what digital money should be: fast, free, and green. Neither charges you fees to
send money (feeless transactions), both confirm payments in a blink, and both avoid energy-hungry mining for the sake of the environment.
In a sense, you can think of them as two electric cars designed for efficiency – both quiet, clean, and quick off the line.
It’s no coincidence; Atto’s creator was **inspired by Nano** and its community when building Atto.
We’re all aiming for the *original* crypto dream: **decentralized digital cash** that anyone can use without cost or hassle.

On a technical level, both Atto and Nano use an innovative ledger structure where **each account has its own chain of blocks**
(like each person keeping their own transaction history). It’s different from Bitcoin or Ethereum where everyone’s transactions share
one big chain (and often wait in one big line). In Atto and Nano, everyone effectively has their **own lane**, so transactions don’t
bottleneck each other.
(If you’ve ever been stuck in one checkout line at a store while other lines are free, you’ll appreciate the multi-lane approach!)
Also, both systems use a form of **double-entry bookkeeping** for transfers – meaning a transaction is recorded as a debit on the
sender’s side and as a credit on the receiver’s side. These similarities are by design, since they’re great ideas that make fast
and feeless transactions possible.

So yes, Atto and Nano *look* like close cousins because they share a lot of proven ideas. But now let’s talk about what Atto did
**differently**. Each of the following features was added or changed in Atto to improve on some aspect of the network.
Some are technical tweaks, but don’t worry – we’ll use simple language or analogies to explain why they matter.

## Block Height – Adding Page Numbers to the Ledger

One key improvement in Atto is the introduction of **block height** in each account’s chain. *Block height* is basically a counter or
sequence number for each transaction/block in an account. Why does that matter? Imagine reading a book where the pages **aren’t numbered**.
If you’re handed a random page, how do you know where it goes in the story? You’d have to scan the text and compare it to the entire book
to figure out where it fits – tedious, right? That’s how Nano’s nodes have to treat incoming transactions, because Nano’s blocks don’t
carry an explicit sequence number. They only link to a previous block by a cryptographic hash (think of that like a unique fingerprint).
It works, but finding where a new piece fits can involve checking against what you already have, much like searching the whole book
for where a page might belong.

Atto fixes this by numbering each block in an account (1, 2, 3, and so on). So when a new transaction arrives with a certain height
(say it’s block number 50 in that account), the node immediately knows, “This is page 50 of Alice’s ledger.” If the node only has up
to page 48, it can tell it’s missing page 49 and needs to catch up. If it already has page 49, then adding page 50 is straightforward.
**In short, adding block height is like putting page numbers on each transaction**, making the whole ledger easier to navigate.
This speeds up validation (you can spot missing pieces at a glance) and makes syncing the network faster.
Nodes no longer have to search by fingerprints alone; they can jump right to where a transaction belongs or detect that it’s old news
if the number is far below what they’ve seen. It’s a simple addition with big benefits for keeping the network lean and up-to-date.

## Node Identification – Less Chatter for Listeners

Another difference is how Atto handles network “chatter” during voting. Both Nano and Atto use **Open Representative Voting (ORV)**,
where certain nodes (representatives) vote on which transactions are valid. In Nano, all nodes end up hearing all vote messages,
even if some nodes aren’t participating in voting. It’s a bit like everyone in a room having to listen to a panel of judges debate
and vote on every single issue – even the people in the back who are just observers. That can create a lot of background noise!

Atto introduces a way for nodes to **identify their roles**, effectively saying whether they’re active voters or just followers.
In practice, this means a node that isn’t a voting representative doesn’t need to receive every single vote message flying around.
It can just receive the final outcomes (the confirmed transactions) without getting bogged down in the intermediate voting chatter.
Using our analogy: the observers in the room don’t have to hear every word the judges say; they just hear the final verdict when
it’s decided. This streamlines network traffic and reduces unnecessary load on non-voting nodes. The network becomes more efficient
because messages are routed more intelligently – representatives still discuss and vote, but the “silent bystanders” aren’t flooded
with every whisper. They get to stay in the loop **only when it really matters**, i.e., when a decision (vote result) is finalized.

For a non-technical user, what this means is that **Atto’s network has reduced network requirements**, since those who just want to run
a node to track the ledger don’t have to dedicate as much bandwidth and processing to all the consensus noise.
It’s like subscribing to highlights of a game instead of watching every play-by-play when you’re not on the team.

## Timestamps – Keeping Transactions Fresh and in Order

When you make a transaction in Atto, the block includes a **timestamp** (the current time according to the sender).
This is another area where Atto diverged from Nano. In Nano, there’s no timestamp on each block; the network just assumes the order
based on when blocks are received and their logical sequence. Atto decided to add timestamps, and this brings a few key advantages.

**First: Freshness-based scheduling.**
When the network is busy, timestamps help nodes **prioritize fresher transactions** among those that are within the acceptable time window.
Transactions closer to the current time are processed first, which keeps the system responsive and fair under load.

**Second: Validity window & anti-precompute.**
Atto enforces a simple rule: if a block’s timestamp is too far in the **future**, it’s **rejected**. If it’s too far in the **past**,
it’s **accepted but de-prioritized** relative to transactions closer to “now.” This both preserves ordering and **prevents precomputed spam** from being unleashed later, since out-of-window future timestamps won’t be accepted at all.

**Third: Automatic PoW adjustments.**
Timestamps allow the **proof-of-work difficulty** to **increase automatically every two years** without changing the block format
or requiring a protocol upgrade. The network **uses** the timestamp in each block to determine the current period and apply
the appropriate difficulty, avoiding disruptive version bumps just to tweak PoW.

## Confirmed-Only Building – No Unconfirmed Dependencies Allowed

This is a more nuanced technical improvement, but an important one for network health. In Atto, a new block will only be accepted if the
block it points to (usually the previous block in that account, or the send block it’s receiving) is already known **and confirmed**
by the network. In Nano, under some conditions, a node might hear about a new block that references a previous one it hasn’t seen yet;
the node would then have to go find that missing piece (this is sometimes called a “lazy bootstrap” scenario). Attackers could exploit
that by throwing lots of out-of-order pieces at nodes to keep them busy.

Atto takes a stricter stance: basically **“I won’t believe this new block exists until I’ve seen and confirmed its parent block.”**
It’s like saying you can’t build the second floor of a house until the first floor is complete and certified solid. If someone tries
to hand in a block that depends on another block which isn’t confirmed in the ledger, Atto nodes will reject it outright.
This closes a potential attack avenue where bad actors might try to confuse the network with chains of unconfirmed transactions or
cause extra load by making nodes chase down unknown references.

In simpler terms, imagine a story where someone tries to publish Chapter 5 when Chapter 4 isn’t out yet. Atto’s rules would refuse to
accept Chapter 5 until Chapter 4 is published and acknowledged by everyone. By doing so, the story (transaction history) always remains
coherent and attackers can’t slip in “future chapters” to mess things up. For the user, this means more security and stability – every
new transaction builds on a firmly confirmed history, no exceptions. It helps the network **stay in consensus and avoid confusion**,
even under attack.

## Standard Cryptography – Compatibility over Custom Speed

Here’s a difference that most users won’t notice on the surface, but it makes life easier for developers and integrators:
**Atto uses standard Ed25519 cryptography for signatures**, whereas Nano uses a slightly modified version of Ed25519 with a
different hashing algorithm (Blake2b instead of the usual SHA-512). What does that techno-babble mean? Basically, both Atto and
Nano rely on elliptic curve digital signatures (Ed25519) to secure transactions – that’s how your wallet proves “I am the owner of
these funds and I authorized this transaction” without revealing your private key. Nano’s implementation made a tweak to use a
faster hash (Blake2b) in the signing process to squeeze out more performance. The downside is that this **custom scheme isn’t
part of most crypto libraries or hardware by default**. It’s like a slightly different dialect that not everyone speaks.

Atto chose to stick with the **standard Ed25519** as defined in common libraries and protocols. This means if you pick up a typical
cryptographic library, or you use a hardware security module (HSM) or hardware wallet, it likely supports Ed25519 out-of-the-box – and
Atto’s signatures will be compatible with it. In contrast, using Nano’s custom variant often requires special code or forks of libraries.
By using the standard approach, Atto prioritizes **compatibility and ease of integration**.

Think of it like phone chargers: Nano’s choice is a bit like a proprietary fast-charger – it might charge a little faster,
but if you lose that charger, you can’t just borrow any cable lying around, and not all chargers will fit. Atto’s method is like using
the common USB-C charger that everyone has; it might be a hair slower in theory, but it works everywhere without special adapters.
And in practice, the speed difference is negligible – we’re talking maybe a few nanoseconds difference in signing a transaction,
which is nothing when the real bottlenecks are network latency and disk speed, not the signature algorithm.

## Why a New Project Instead of a Nano Update?

By now you might wonder: if Nano already had a great foundation and Atto’s improvements sound like tweaks, why didn’t Atto’s creator
just **build these features into Nano**? Why start a whole new cryptocurrency? It’s a fair question, and the answer comes down to
practicality and scope. Some changes are easy to propose in an existing project, but **others would be like trying to change an
airplane’s engine mid-flight** – extremely risky and time-consuming!

Nano was (and is) a live network used by many. Making deep, fundamental changes to its core (like altering how blocks work,
adding new fields like height and timestamp, changing the consensus messaging, etc.) would be a massive undertaking.
It’s not that the Nano devs aren’t capable – it’s that you can’t break the existing system for users. It would require
every node to upgrade in sync, and it could disrupt the smooth operation that Nano already has. In software terms,
Nano is that airplane in mid-flight: you can’t just swap out critical parts on the fly without causing turbulence or worse, a crash.
The Nano community did an amazing job pioneering feeless transactions, and their network has been running for years. Over those years,
certain design decisions became baked in, and reversing or overhauling them is slow and challenging (if even possible) because
so much depends on them now.

Atto began as an independent effort – in fact, it started as an attempt to re-implement a Nano-like node in a more memory-safe
programming language. Along the way, a list of “wouldn’t it be nice if…?” improvements emerged (the ones we’ve been discussing).
Adding one or two of those to Nano might be conceivable through the normal improvement proposal process. But adding **all of them**
together? That would have meant essentially creating a *new* version of Nano that would be very hard to make backward-compatible.
At that point, it made more sense to actually **create a new project** from scratch, where these ideas could be built in
from day one rather than retrofitted.

It’s important to note this isn’t about one approach being “better” in an absolute sense – it’s about experimentation and evolution.
Atto is exploring a slightly different design, one that hopes to be more resilient and efficient in the long run, but it owes a
lot to Nano’s original blueprint. Both planes share the same destination (a world of instant, feeless payments),
just taking different routes to get there.

## Conclusion: A Fresh Start Built on Proven Ideas

Atto is **not a fork of Nano** in the codebase sense – it was built from the ground up, not copied. However, it **is a spiritual sibling**
in many ways: it took inspiration from Nano’s successes (and also learned from some challenges). You could say Nano walked so that
Atto could run. We’ve gone over how Atto introduces block heights, node identification, timestamps, stricter confirmation requirements,
and standard crypto algorithms to push the idea of feeless digital cash a step further. These changes aim to make the network easier to use,
more robust against attacks, and friendlier to integrate with other technology.

None of this is to say Nano’s approach was wrong – on the contrary, Nano pioneered the way. Atto exists because Nano proved that a
feeless, instant-transfer cryptocurrency *can* work and change the game. The Atto project owes a huge
**shout-out to Nano and its community**. Nano’s developers and supporters created a foundation that inspired us to dream bigger
and try our own twist. We have immense respect for the Nano community; they are among the most open, passionate, and technically
savvy folks in crypto. Without Nano, there would be no Atto.

In the end, both Atto and Nano share the same end goal: making money truly digital, instant, and accessible to all without fees.
Atto just chose to take an independent path to explore new improvements toward that goal. We hope this clears up the misconception – Atto
isn’t “just a fork” of Nano, even if it stands on Nano’s shoulders. It’s a new project with its own journey. And as Atto grows, we aim
to foster the same kind of positive, innovative community that Nano has, all while pushing the envelope of what feeless crypto can do.
