I recently wrote a Python wrapper for the Atto Node API
([GitHub](https://github.com/waldolemmer/atto.py)), and I wanted to share my
journey‚Äîfrom figuring out how to convert Atto addresses, to designing around
Python‚Äôs async model, to publishing a usable API wrapper. Hopefully, this helps
someone else who's either interested in Atto or wants to see what writing an
API wrapper looks like from a beginner's perspective.

## üöÄ Why I Started

At the time, there were no API wrappers available for Atto. The only tools
available were browser-based:  
- [`wallet.atto.cash`](https://wallet.atto.cash)  
- [`atto.cash/explorer`](https://atto.cash/explorer)

I wanted to play around with the API, but to do that, I needed to convert an
Atto public key (a base32-encoded string) into a hex string, which the API
expects. I wrote some code for this in Python, the journey of which I'll expand
on below.

Using `curl` and copying and pasting addresses to make requests was getting
tedious, so I switched to using Python for that too.
At some point, I realized: *‚ÄúI‚Äôm already halfway to an API wrapper. Why not
finish it?‚Äù*. There weren‚Äôt that many endpoints, so it seemed like a manageable
project.

As a student, this felt like a fun way to procrastinate from real work‚Ñ¢.

---

## üß† Reverse Engineering the Address Format

I started by figuring out how the Atto address (e.g., `atto://...`) becomes a
public key that the API understands.

After poking around the [Atto org](https://github.com/attocash/) on
GitHub, I found this bit of Kotlin:

```kotlin
private fun String.fromAddress(): ByteArray {
    return Base32.decode(this.substring(SCHEMA.length).uppercase() + "===")
}
```

This seemed straightforward. So, I implemented the decoding part in Python:

```python
import base64

# Should not include the schema (atto://)
address = '<address>'
address_bytes = base64.b32decode(address.upper() + '===')

for byte in address_bytes:
    print(format(byte, '02X'), end='')
```

But my curl requests were failing. Comparing my output with a network request
from the actual wallet, I noticed extra bytes in my output.

With Rotilho (the creator of Atto)'s help, we tracked it down:
- The first byte is the **version**.
- The last 5 bytes are a **checksum**.

These are only needed for human-readable addresses, and the API doesn't want
them. So I just sliced them off:

```python
for byte in address_bytes[1:-5]:
    #                    ^^^^^^
    print(format(byte, '02X'), end='')
```

Clean hex output, and the API was happy.

## üß™ Curl Fatigue and First Scripts

I initially used `curl` for quick API checks, but copying and pasting addresses
and typing out endpoints repeatedly got old, fast. So I wrote a script in
Python to make it easier.

Eventually, I wanted something cleaner and more structured‚Äîa proper API
wrapper.

---

## üß∞ Building the Library

### The Basics

I started with a simple `AttoNode` class and used Python‚Äôs built-in `requests`
module for non-streaming endpoints, like:

```http
GET /accounts/{publicKey}
```

That part was smooth.

### The Async Problem

Streaming endpoints, however, were a challenge. Using `requests.get()` blocks
the thread‚Äîbad news for real-time updates.

In search of the part that was blocking (and with hopes of writing a
non-blocking version of `requests.get()`), I dug into the source code of
`requests.get()`, which led me to some internal methods, which led me to
`urllib3`. This quickly turned into a rabbit hole.

So I looked for an alternative. That‚Äôs when ChatGPT introduced me to
asynchronous programming:

```python
import httpx
import asyncio

async def stream_lines(url):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        async with client.stream("GET", url) as response:
            async for line in response.aiter_lines():
                print(f"Got line: {line}")

asyncio.run(stream_lines("http://example.com/stream"))
```

This was my first time diving into async io. Naturally, I got confused. A lot.

---

## üßµ Learning Async the Hard Way

I turned to [Real Python‚Äôs async
guide](https://realpython.com/async-io-python/)‚Äîan excellent but *long* read.
It gave me a rough understanding.

Then I discovered the [Trio](https://github.com/python-trio/trio/) project and
Nathaniel J. Smith‚Äôs blog post:  
["Notes on structured concurrency (or: Go statement considered
harmful)"](https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/)
‚Äî I would highly recommend it.

I decided to build my async version using `trio`. But `aiohttp`, the popular
async HTTP library shown in the Real Python article, doesn‚Äôt support Trio
natively. So I found `httpx` instead, which does.

---

## üß© Sync vs Async: The Dilemma

At this point, I had a tough decision:

- Write a **synchronous** library ‚Üí beginner-friendly, but can‚Äôt handle streaming.
- Write an **async** library ‚Üí handles streaming, but alienates newcomers.

So I asked ChatGPT what other API wrappers do. To minimize hallucinations, I
approached it methodically:

[A screenshot of ChatGPT. The prompt is: Name a few Python libraries that wrap HTTP APIs](./chatgpt-screenshot-1.png)
[A screenshot of ChatGPT. The prompt is: For each of these, repeat one of its request call signatures, and determine whether it is blocking or async](./chatgpt-screenshot-2.png)
[A screenshot of ChatGPT. The prompt is: To recap, make three lists (sync, async, both) based on only the official libraries](./chatgpt-screenshot-3.png)

From that research, I concluded that supporting both is the best option.
Separate clients‚Äîone sync, one async.

## üßæ Summary

This little side project took me through:

- Reverse engineering some simple decoding logic
- Navigating Kotlin, Python, and Javascript
- Discovering the world of asynchronous programming
- Learning Trio and choosing the right HTTP client
- Making design choices while writing a Python library

And in the end, I‚Äôve got a clean, usable API wrapper‚Äîand a lot more knowledge.

And, as a bonus, I got to write documentation (using
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/)), publish it to
[Read the Docs](https://attopyreadthedocs.io), and publish a package to
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/atto.py) for everyone to install using
`pip install atto.py`. All that in roughly half a day using
[PyScaffold](https://pyscaffold.org/).

If you‚Äôre interested in testing it out, I‚Äôd love to hear from you! You can find
the repo [here](https://github.com/waldolemmer/atto.py). I'm not currently
accepting pull requests, though, because there's still a lot of work left that
I have planned out in my head.
