Weâ€™re excited to announce a new way to earn Atto while helping the world: **contribute your spare computing power to [Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/)**. Starting today, you can mine Atto by joining the fight against diseases like cancer, Alzheimerâ€™s, and moreâ€”no GPUs or crypto rigs required.

## Why Mining Through Folding@Home?

Atto was designed to be fast, feeless, and accessible. A key challenge has always been fair distributionâ€”especially without resorting to a traditional ICO or mining. Our initial approach was simple: use a faucet. Users could visit a webpage, solve a CAPTCHA, and receive a small amount of Atto to get started.

But as AI advanced, so did bots. Even relatively sophisticated CAPTCHAs were quickly bypassed, making the faucet unsustainable as a primary distribution method. Weâ€™re keeping it around, but it's no longer enough.

Thatâ€™s why we're taking a new approachâ€”one that rewards people for contributing something genuinely useful: their CPU time.

## How It Works

Folding@Home is a distributed computing project that simulates protein folding. These simulations help researchers understand diseases and develop better treatments. When you join Folding@Home through our miner integration, youâ€™re not just earning Attoâ€”youâ€™re making a meaningful contribution to science.

Itâ€™s simple:
- You install the miner.
- It runs Folding@Home tasks in the background.
- You earn Atto based on your contributions.

We think this is a win-win: it decentralizes the distribution of Atto while doing something good for the world.

## Get Started

Weâ€™ve created a step-by-step guide to help you get started. Whether you're on Windows, Linux, or macOS, it's easy to set up and start mining today.
