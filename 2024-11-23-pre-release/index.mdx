Hello, everyone!

I'm Felipe, and I want to share a bit of my journey with you. A couple of years ago, I set out to build Atto because I believe in what cryptocurrency originally set out to achieve—fast, decentralized, accessible digital cash for everyone, without the need for intermediaries. But somewhere along the way, it felt like much of the crypto community lost sight of that vision. Instead of 'let's make digital cash work,' the conversation shifted to 'what's the next moonshot?'. That's when I thought, "How hard could it be to create a cryptocurrency that just works for payments?"

Spoiler alert: It's really hard. What started as a fun little project to tinker with in my free time quickly evolved into something much bigger—something that I thought could be finished in a year but has kept me on my toes for much longer. The process of creating a new cryptocurrency is like peeling an endless onion—every time you think you've figured it out, there's another layer waiting for you. A lot of things needed to come together to make this work: the code, the security, the ecosystem, and the community. It turned out to be more challenging than I'd ever imagined.

Right now, I'm juggling all sorts of tasks—testing, fixing bugs, talking with notaries, adjusting UI, and much more. The truth is, I'm at the point where I can't do this alone anymore. About two months ago, it became clear that I needed help. I tried reaching out to folks to bring them on board early, but it turns out I'm not exactly a natural salesperson So instead, I waited until things got more stable and ready for others to jump in. And that time is now.

## So, what's Atto?

Atto is a digital cash system designed to be fast, secure, and incredibly simple to use. It fulfills the core promise of what cryptocurrency was always meant to be: a practical, censorship-resistant payment solution that anyone can use, anywhere, without waiting forever for transactions to clear. With confirmation times that happen in under a second, Atto is built for real life—whether you're paying for your morning coffee or sending money across continents. It's a payment network for everyone who believes that digital cash should be simple and dependable, not something tied to market speculation or hype.

## And this is where you come in.

Atto is ready enough to bring people on board, though it's far from perfectly polished. We have a working wallet, a faucet for getting started, and a reward bot to acknowledge contributions. There's still a lot to be done, and I want to invite anyone interested to help shape the future of Atto with me. Whether you like tinkering with code, testing new features, or just want to be part of a movement, there's a place for you here. Every contribution to the public repositories is rewarded with Attos, and we want to acknowledge your efforts as part of building something real from the ground up. You can learn more about the reward program here: [https://atto.cash/docs/reward-for-contributions](https://atto.cash/docs/reward-for-contributions).

If you're tired of seeing the same crypto projects promising the world but forgetting about real-world usability, then I hope you'll join us. Atto isn't about hype; it's about delivering a fast, dependable digital cash experience for everyone. Let's make it happen—together.
