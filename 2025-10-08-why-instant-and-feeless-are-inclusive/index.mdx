Digital money should work for everyone, but today’s payment systems often fall short. Whether we’re buying a coffee,
reading an article or a machine is paying another machine to call an API, fees and delays can quietly exclude entire
groups of users and use‑cases. This article explains why instant and feeless payment networks are crucial for real
financial inclusion, how they unlock tiny micropayments and machine‑to‑machine interactions, and why projects
like [Atto](https://atto.cash) and [Nano](https://nano.org) show what a truly accessible payment network looks like.

## Fees Exclude Both People and Use‑Cases

Small fees hit those most in need the hardest. In many regions the average transaction fee of a few cents is a
significant percentage of a typical purchase. In markets where incomes are low, even a one‑cent fee represents a
meaningful cost. The result is that many people remain in cash‑based economies—often in countries with weak or unstable
currencies—which further excludes them from global digital financial services.

Micro‑sized payments are impossible when fees exceed the value. Standard payment rails charge a fixed fee plus a
percentage, meaning that a $0.10 or $0.30 payment may be completely eaten by fees. Even when content creators want to
charge 10 cents to read an article or tip a few cents, the infrastructure cannot support it.

Advertising revenue shows how tiny micropayments need to be. Mobile app publishers earn
about $0.50–2.50 per thousand banner ad impressions on iOS and $0.25–1.50 on Android. That means each ad view generates
just $0.00025–0.0025 – less than one‑fifth of a cent. Even rewarded video ads, which pay the most, generate roughly $
10–30 per thousand views, or only one to three cents per view. If a user decided to pay the content creator directly to
skip ads, the payment would need to be fractions of a cent – impossible on fee‑based networks.

## Why Instant Settlement Matters

Imagine you’re in a packed metro queue at rush hour—São Paulo, Tokyo, Paris. Five silent seconds at the turnstile feels
like forever as the crowd behind you starts to fidget. Online, a couple of seconds is usually fine; in person it isn’t.
**In person payments often need near‑instant responses**; Atto’s 0.45‑second confirmations pop the gate open before
frustration turns into a bottleneck.

Beyond human interactions, the need for instant settlement extends to the digital realm as well. The machine economy
demands millisecond settlement. In the emerging AI and Internet‑of‑Things (IoT) economy, autonomous agents pay each
other for API calls or data streams. AI agents may make thousands of calls per second, each costing about $0.0001;
traditional payment fees make these microtransactions unprofitable and settlement times of 2–3 days are unacceptable.
Such use‑cases illustrate why instant is not a luxury but a prerequisite for digital ecosystems where machines transact
autonomously.

## The Promise of Micropayments

Micropayments—tiny transactions under a few dollars or even fractions of a cent—unlock new possibilities rather than
just lowering fees. They let people pay per use, per read, or per view, instead of being locked into
a [subscription trap](https://atto.cash/blog/escaping-the-monthly-subscription-trap). A few cents at a time can make
digital content, tools, and services more accessible while giving creators steady income and fair value for their work.

Atto makes this practical by confirming every transaction individually in 0.45 seconds—fast enough to feel instant and
small enough to make micro‑economies thrive. It enables tipping, pay‑as‑you‑go access, and even automated
machine‑to‑machine exchanges, showing how the smallest payments can have the biggest impact.

### Comparison with Fee‑Based Networks

To appreciate the inclusivity of Atto, it helps to contrast it with traditional payment networks and other
cryptocurrencies. The table below summarizes the key differences:

| System              | Average Fee                          | Settlement Time    | Limitations                               |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Legacy Credit Cards | 1–3% + fixed fee                     | 24–72 hours        | High costs make small payments infeasible |
| Bitcoin / Ethereum  | Varies from cents to tens of dollars | 10–300 minutes     | Network congestion, expensive and slow    |
| Layer‑2 Solutions   | Low, but complex                     | Seconds to minutes | Requires channels and liquidity locks     |
| Atto                | 0                                    | 0.45 seconds       | None — feeless and instant on base layer  |

By comparison, Atto provides feeless, near‑instant settlement on the base layer itself. There is no minimum payment
size; a user can send a millionth of a unit and pay no fee. Confirmation occurs in fractions of a second, allowing
payments at subway turnstiles or between AI agents without waiting for network authorization. These properties make the
network inclusive for both people and emerging machine economies.

## Real‑World Use‑Cases Enabled by Instant & Feeless Payments

1. Tipping and Pay‑Per‑Use Content. A micropayment model lets readers pay a few cents for each article they read or tip
creators directly. Without fees, publishers can accept micro‑tips without losing revenue, and consumers are more
willing to pay small amounts. This democratizes access to information and compensates creators fairly.
2. Micropayments for Apps and Games. Mobile game developers often rely on ads that pay only fractions of a cent per
view. Feeless payments allow them to ask users for a tiny contribution to remove ads or unlock features, creating a
sustainable revenue model without intrusive advertising.
3. AI and IoT Payments. Machine‑to‑machine transactions for API calls, data streaming or device services require
micropayments around $0.0001. Traditional payment systems cannot handle such transactions because fees and settlement
times are too high. A feeless network with millisecond settlement allows these microservices to flourish.
4. Transit and High‑Throughput Environments. Subway and bus fare systems must authorize a payment in under a second.
Fee‑based networks that take seconds or minutes to settle would choke a turnstile and inconvenience passengers.
Instant settlement networks enable seamless transit payments without preloaded passes.
5. Cross‑Border Remittances. Workers often send small amounts back home. Fees of several dollars and settlement delays
of days reduce the remitted amount and force people to use complicated channels. Feeless networks with near‑instant
settlement allow cross‑border payments of any size, ensuring the full value reaches the recipient in about 0.45
seconds.

## Conclusion

The future of digital money hinges on instant and feeless payments. Fees, even when they seem small, disproportionately
impact low‑income users and make micropayments economically impossible. Delays of seconds or minutes discourage
real‑time applications and create congestion. By contrast, networks like Atto eliminate transaction fees and achieve
0.45‑second settlement. These properties unlock a spectrum of use‑cases—from tipping a content creator a fraction of a
cent to AI agents paying per API call—and bring digital cash to everyone. As society moves toward an Internet of money
where humans and machines transact seamlessly, feeless and instant payment networks will be the foundation of true
financial inclusion.
