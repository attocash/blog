# Path to Decentralization

<IdealImage img={require('./decentralization.jpg')}/>

Atto is on a mission to change how we think about and use digital currencies. While its ultimate goal is complete decentralization, it is intentionally starting out as a centralized currency. This might seem counterintuitive, but it's a deliberate move to build a strong foundation for a decentralized future.

In this article, we'll discuss why Atto chose to start centralized, how it plans to become decentralized over time, and what mechanisms are in place to encourage a vibrant, active network. We'll look at how rewarding voting nodes, promoting a competitive node market, and implementing decaying votes play crucial roles in this journey.

## Why Begin Centralized?

Starting off centralized gives Atto the chance to build stability, security, and efficiency right from the beginning. Centralization makes it easier to make quick decisions, update protocols when needed, and avoid risks that can plague young decentralized networks—like low participation or vulnerability to attacks.

By keeping control centralized at first, Atto can ensure everything runs smoothly while more users join and more nodes come online. This approach lets the team monitor and adjust the network carefully, without dealing with the complexities of having a built-in distribution mechanism in the protocol from day one.

## The Road to Decentralization

Atto has a detailed plan to become decentralized over the next three years, aiming to reach a Satoshi Nakamoto coefficient of 10. If you're not familiar with the term, the Satoshi Nakamoto coefficient measures how many entities control enough power to make decisions on their own. So, achieving a coefficient of 10 means that it would take at least 10 separate entities working together to confirm transactions. This strengthens the network's resilience and true decentralization.

### Ledger Immutability and Security

A key feature of Atto is that, even if only one entity holds significant influence (a Satoshi Nakamoto coefficient of 1), the network's ledger can't be rewritten once transactions are confirmed. Unlike Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems where a majority can potentially alter transaction history, Atto's consensus model ensures that confirmed transactions are set in stone.

In Atto's network, the majority decides which transactions get confirmed, but no one—not even a powerful group—can change what's already been recorded. This keeps the ledger secure and trustworthy, no matter how centralized or decentralized the network is at any given time.

### Rewarding Voting Nodes

To get more people involved and invested in the network's health, Atto will soon introduce a reward system for voting nodes, with rewards proportional to voting weight, capped at 1%. This incentive aims to attract more participants to run nodes, helping to distribute network influence more evenly.

We expect this reward system to create a competitive market for nodes. Operators will compete for delegations from users by offering the best returns or services. This naturally promotes decentralization without Atto having to directly control it. It's a market-driven approach that encourages transparency, efficiency, and fair distribution of influence across the network.

### Decaying Vote Mechanism

It's crucial that only active participants influence the network's decisions. To ensure voting power reflects those who are actually involved, Atto plans to implement a decaying vote mechanism within the first year.

Here's how it works: if an account becomes inactive, its voting weight gradually decreases over time. This prevents dormant or lost accounts from affecting the network's governance. By reducing the influence of inactive accounts, the network stays dynamic and responsive to the engaged community, making decentralized decision-making more effective.

## Conclusion

Atto's path from centralization to decentralization is a strategic move to balance security, efficiency, and community involvement. By starting centralized, Atto provides a stable platform for growth. Introducing rewards for voting nodes and the decaying vote mechanism are innovative ways to encourage active participation and ensure influence is distributed fairly.

Importantly, Atto's design guarantees that the ledger remains secure and unchangeable, even if a single entity has significant influence. The consensus mechanism prevents any rewriting of transaction history, helping maintain trust in the network.

As Atto works towards achieving a Satoshi Nakamoto coefficient of 10, it's inviting the community to join this transformative journey. The future of Atto depends on its participants, truly embracing the spirit of decentralization.
