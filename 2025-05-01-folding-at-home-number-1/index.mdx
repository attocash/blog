Just a few weeks ago, we launched Atto’s integration with Folding@home – a way for our community to use their idle computers to help scientific research and **earn Atto in return**. Today, we’re thrilled to announce that **[Atto’s Folding@home team has reached the #1 spot on the entire Folding@home network](https://stats.foldingathome.org/team)**, less than a month after launch. This achievement is nothing short of incredible: our team has amassed a **staggering 10,022,348,905 points** and completed **37,941 work units** (individual research tasks) to date. It’s an *astonishing* milestone that showcases what a passionate community can accomplish when united by a common goal.

## A Record-Breaking Achievement in Under a Month

When we introduced Folding@home integration in late March, we knew our community was eager to make a difference – but the speed and scale of your response have exceeded all expectations. In **under one month**, the [Atto team](https://stats.foldingathome.org/team/1066107) rocketed from zero to the very top of the Folding@home leaderboards. For context, Folding@home is a global distributed computing project where volunteers donate computing power to simulate protein folding and fight diseases. Climbing to the #1 position on this platform is a big deal – it means no other team on Earth contributed more computational power to crucial medical research this month than *we* did.

Think about that for a moment. In just a few weeks, our volunteer team – **powered entirely by community members’ computers** – outpaced long-established teams that have been around for years. We rallied together, pushed through **tens of thousands of work units**, and delivered over **ten billion points** of computing toward understanding diseases like cancer, Alzheimer’s, and more. This isn’t just a win for Team Atto; it’s a win for science and humanity. **Your spare CPU/GPU cycles have been saving lives** (or at least bringing lifesaving discoveries closer), and now the world knows what the Atto community is capable of.

## Powered by a Passionate Community

This victory belongs to **every single one of you**. Whether you contributed one work unit or one thousand, whether you ran Folding@home on a modest laptop or a beastly rig, you are part of this success. **Anonymous or not, your contribution mattered.** Together, we’ve proven that a decentralized community can rival the output of corporations and big institutions.

The outpouring of support has been nothing short of inspiring. Every time someone’s PC spun up a Folding@home work unit for Team Atto, it wasn’t just crunching numbers – it was **demonstrating our shared commitment to doing good**. You went out and folded proteins day and night, turning a collective vision into a concrete result. The #1 ranking is a testament to your dedication, teamwork, and belief in Atto’s mission.

To every volunteer in our Folding@home team: **thank you**. Thank you for donating your computing power, for troubleshooting setups, for cheering each other on in chat, and for embracing the idea that *we can make a difference together*. This achievement shows that Atto is far more than just a fast, feeless cryptocurrency – it’s a community-driven movement.

## Building a Decentralized Future, Together

Reaching the #1 spot on Folding@home in such a short time is a powerful reminder of what our community can do. It’s a momentum-builder, and our journey doesn’t stop at this milestone – in fact, we’re just getting started.

For now, let’s **celebrate** this achievement. Take a moment to appreciate the fact that *you* were part of the team that currently sits atop a global network of contributors. That’s huge! Share the news with friends and fellow tech enthusiasts: it’s not every day that a new crypto project becomes the top contributor to a renowned scientific initiative in under a month. It’s a story worth telling, and it underscores what makes Atto different.

Most importantly, let’s carry forward the spirit that got us here. Keep folding if you can – the research needs our help as much as ever, and every additional work unit could be the one that leads to a breakthrough. Keep spreading the word about Atto’s mission of marrying decentralized tech with real-world impact. And keep believing that **a better, greener, more inclusive crypto future is possible** – because we’re actively building it right now.

Once again, **to our amazing community, thank you**. Achievements like this #1 ranking on Folding@home happen when *everyone* pitches in. It’s proof that our ethos of cooperation and altruism isn’t just idealistic talk, but a practical path to success. We’re incredibly grateful, incredibly proud, and more motivated than ever to see what this community will accomplish next.
